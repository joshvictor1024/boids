## What is Boids?

Boids is a flocking model by Craig Reynolds. Each agent, called "boid", follows three rules:

- separation: avoid crowding nearby boids
- alignment: match the velocities of other boids
- cohesion: match the average position of other boids

The boids as a whole exhibits a flocking behavior.
